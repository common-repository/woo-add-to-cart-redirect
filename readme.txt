Plugin sets a redirect link to the WooCommerce "Add To Cart" button

== Description ==
Plugin adds a redirect link to the "Add To Cart" button on the products page, so by clicking on it you will be
redirected to the specified URL instead of opening the WooCommerce cart. You can set the individul URLs (redirect links) per each product individually. Besides you can set the redirect link for one product and keep the original "Add To Cart" process for another.  "Add To Cart" button should not have a different look either it redirects to some URL or keeps working as it is in normal WooCommerce. Thus there are flexible management opportunities of the "Add To Cart" button work logic. Plugin is ideal to magnify traffic from multiple WooCommerce satellites to the any target site or few ones. It will boost your sales significantly!
